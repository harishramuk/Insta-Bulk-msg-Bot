# Instagram DM bot

Instagram DM bot with account switcher feature. This bot can send messages automatically in your list of usernames.
It will send DMs and switch account automatically. It will switch account every 10 messages, so this means it will
change account after it sends message to 10 usernames and then it will go to the next account.
